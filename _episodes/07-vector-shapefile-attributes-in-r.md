This episode continues our discussion of vector layer attributes and 
covers how to work with vector layer attributes in R. It covers how
to identify and query layer
attributes, as well as how to subset features by specific attribute values.
Finally, we will learn how to plot a feature according to a set of attribute
values.

## Load the Data
We will continue using the `sf`, `raster` and `ggplot2` packages in this episode. Make sure that you have these packages loaded. We will
continue to work with the three shapefiles (vector layers) that we loaded in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode.

## Query Vector Feature Metadata

As we discussed in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode,
we can view metadata associated with an R object using:

* `st_geometry_type()` - The type of vector data stored in the object.
* `nrow()` - The number of features in the object
* `st_bbox()` - The spatial extent (geographic area covered by) 
of the object.
* `st_crs()` - The CRS (spatial projection) of the data.

We started to explore our `point_HARV` object in the previous episode.
To see a summary of all of the metadata associated with our `point_HARV` object, we can view the object with `View(point_HARV)` or print a summary of the object itself to the console.

We can use the `ncol` function to count the number of attributes associated with a spatial object too. Note that the geometry is just another column and counts towards the total.

We can view the individual name of each attribute using the
`names()` function in R:

We could also view just the first 6 rows
of attribute values using the `head()` function to get a preview of the data:

## Explore Values within One Attribute
We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
Comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a data frame, this is similar
to exploring values in a column. We did this with the `gapminder` dataframe in [an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/05-data-subsetting/index.html). For spatial objects, we can use the same syntax: `objectName$attributeName`.

We can see the contents of the `TYPE` field of our lines feature:


~~~
lines_HARV$TYPE
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] "woods road" "footpath"   "footpath"   "stone wall" "stone wall"
 [6] "stone wall" "stone wall" "stone wall" "stone wall" "boardwalk" 
[11] "woods road" "woods road" "woods road"
~~~
{: .output}

To see only unique values within the `TYPE` field, we can use the
`levels()` function for extracting the possible values of a
categorical variable. The special term for categorical variables
within R is factor. We worked with factors a little bit in [an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/03-data-structures-part1/index.html).


~~~
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
NULL
~~~
{: .output}

### Subset Features
We can use the `filter()` function from `dplyr` that we worked with in [an earlier lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/06-dplyr) to select a subset of features
from a spatial object in R, just like with data frames.

For example, we might be interested only in features that are of `TYPE` "footpath". Once we subset out this data, we can use it as input to other code so that code only operates on the footpath lines.


~~~
footpath_HARV <- lines_HARV %>% 
  filter(TYPE == "footpath")
nrow(footpath_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2
~~~
{: .output}

Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count to 2. This means
that only two feature lines in our spatial object have the attribute
`TYPE == footpath`. We can plot only the footpath lines:


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = footpath_HARV) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Footpaths") + 
  coord_sf()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-plot-subset-shapefile-1.png" title="Map of the footpaths in the study area." alt="Map of the footpaths in the study area." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There are two features in our footpaths subset. Why does the plot look like
there is only one feature? Let's adjust the colors used in our plot. If we have
2 features in our vector object, we can plot each using a unique color by
assigning a column name to the color aesthetic (`color =`). We use the syntax
`aes(color = )` to do this. We can also alter the default line thickness by
using the `size =` parameter, as the default value of 0.5 can be hard to see.
Note that size is placed outside of the `aes()` function, as we are not
connecting line thickness to a data variable.


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = footpath_HARV, aes(color = factor(OBJECTID)), size = 1.5) +
  labs(color = 'Footpath ID') +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Footpaths") + 
  coord_sf()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-plot-subset-shapefile-unique-colors-1.png" title="Map of the footpaths in the study area where each feature is colored differently." alt="Map of the footpaths in the study area where each feature is colored differently." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now, we see that there are in fact two features in our plot!

## Customize Plots

In the examples above, `ggplot()` automatically selected colors for
each line based on a default color order. If we don't like those
default colors, we can create a vector of colors - one for each
feature. To create this vector we can use the following syntax:

`c("color_one", "color_two", "color_three")[object$factor]`

Note in the above example we have

1. a vector of colors - one for each factor value (unique attribute value)
2. the attribute itself (`[object$factor]`) of class factor.

First we will check how many unique levels our factor has:


~~~
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
NULL
~~~
{: .output}

Then we can create a palette of four colors, one for each
feature in our vector object.


~~~
road_colors <- c("blue", "green", "navy", "purple")
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can tell `ggplot` to use these colors when we plot the data.


~~~
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads & Trails") + 
  coord_sf()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-harv-paths-map-1.png" title="Roads and trails in the area." alt="Roads and trails in the area." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Adjust Line Width
We adjusted line width universally earlier. If we want a unique line width for each factor level or attribute category
in our spatial object, we can use the same syntax that we used for colors, above.

We already know that we have four different `TYPE` levels in the lines_HARV object, so we will set four different line widths.


~~~
line_widths <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can use those line widths when we plot the data.


~~~
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE, size = TYPE)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  scale_size_manual(values = line_widths) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Line width varies") + 
  coord_sf()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-07-harv-paths-map-wide-1.png" title="Roads and trails in the area demonstrating how to use different line thickness and colors." alt="Roads and trails in the area demonstrating how to use different line thickness and colors." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that we could also use `aes(size = TYPE)` to tie the line thickness to the TYPE variable, so long as we had been careful to set factor levels appropriately. ggplot prints a warning when you do this, because it is not considered a good practice to plot non-spatial data this way.

### Add Plot Legend

We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we use the following
elements to specify labels and colors:

* `bottomright`: We specify the location of our legend by using a default
keyword. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.
* `levels(objectName$attributeName)`: Label the legend elements using the
categories of levels in an attribute (e.g., levels(lines_HARV$TYPE) means use
the levels boardwalk, footpath, etc).
* `fill =`: apply unique colors to the boxes in our legend. `palette()` is
the default set of colors that R applies to all plots.

Let's add a legend to our plot. We will use the `road_colors` object
that we created above to color the legend. We can customize the
appearance of our legend by manually setting different parameters.


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", 
          subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Default Legend") + 
  coord_sf()

We can change the appearance of our legend by manually setting different parameters.

* `legend.text`: change the font size
* `legend.box.background`: add an outline box


~~~

  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1.5) +
